 # Welcome to Bite-Sized R

###**Subscribe For Email Alerts When New Material Is Posted - Click Here**

This project represents an educational opportunity aimed to provide beginners training into R, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics.  This set of videos, tutorials, and exercises is a combined effort presented by the Organization Of Fish and Wildlife Information Managers (OFWIM) and Keith Hurley.

Each *video* (called a snack) in the series is listed below.  *Handouts* are pdf files available for download that cover the same material presented in the snack.  *Exercises* are challenages used to put the lessons into practice while the *Answers* provided one way of completing the exercises.

The best learning always happens by doing, so most of the snacks are meant to be viewed while working along in R-studio.  A second monitor is particularly helpful to allow you to run the snack video on one screen while working with Rstudio on the other screen.  The snacks do move quickly so you may find it helpful to pause & continue as you work your way through the snack.  Alternatively, you may wish to view the snack, and then work your way through the material on your own computer using the handouts provided.

The first group of snacks get you setup with the software and prepared to start working with R.  These snacks are of a show and tell variety and there's really no need to type along, but make sure you install the software as directed and try out the exercises in the Package snack - they'll help you get your computer prepped for what is to come.

Let's take a look at some of the basics of R syntax and code structure.  This group of snacks is aimed to give you a basic understanding of how the R language works and to help recognize some of the base functions and techniques that will appear through the bite-size R series.  Feel free to type along if you wish.

Now we're getting to the good stuff.  It's time to take a look at how data is stored and handled inside of R.  Some of these snacks will be of the show and tell variety while others will encourage you to work along with the video.  After watching a snack, please download and attmept the exercises if they are available to help put things into practice!  Please stick with it, these are important things to know - we're almost to the fun part.

Time to start doing things with data!  The next group of snacks will introduce you to data manipulations and operations to shape, clean, and prepare your datasets for analysis and visualization.  These snacks will lay the foundation for all the data work that you will do in R.  Please type along with the videos and work on the exercises.
